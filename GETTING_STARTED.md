## 🎬 Step 1: Backend Setup (3 minutes)

### Open Terminal 1

```bash
# Navigate to backend folder
cd backend

# Create virtual environment (30 seconds)
python -m venv venv

# Activate it (Windows)
venv\Scripts\activate

# You should see (venv) in your prompt now

# Install dependencies (1-2 minutes)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create environment file
copy .env.example .env

# Seed the database with sample data (10 seconds)
python seed_data.py

# Start the backend server
python main.py
```

**✅ Success!** You should see:
```
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000
```

**Keep this terminal open!** ⚠️

## 🎨 Step 2: Frontend Setup (2 minutes)

### Open Terminal 2 (New Window)

```bash
# Navigate to frontend folder
cd frontend

# Install dependencies (1-2 minutes)
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start
```

**✅ Success!** Your browser will automatically open to `http://localhost:3000`

**Keep this terminal open too!** ⚠️

## 🎓 Understanding What You Built

### The Recommendation Flow

```
1. User interacts with products
   ↓
2. System tracks behavior in database
   ↓
3. ML algorithm analyzes patterns
   ↓
4. Generates personalized recommendations
   ↓
5. LLM creates human-readable explanations
   ↓
6. Beautiful UI displays results
```

### The Technology Stack

**Backend:**
- FastAPI (Python web framework)
- SQLite (Database)
- Scikit-learn (Machine learning)
- OpenAI (AI explanations)

**Frontend:**
- React (UI framework)
- Modern CSS (Beautiful design)

## 💡 Cool Things to Try

### 1. Create Your Own Behavior Pattern
- Go to "All Products" tab
- Click "View" on all Electronics products
- Go back to "Recommendations"
- Click Refresh
- See more Electronics recommended!

### 2. Compare Users
- Note recommendations for john_doe
- Switch to jane_smith
- Compare the differences
- Each user has unique preferences!

### 3. Test the Match Score
- Higher match scores = better fit
- Try to get a 90%+ match score
- Interact with similar products

### 4. Read Different Explanations
- Each explanation is unique
- Generated by AI based on context
- Notice how they reference user behavior

---

## 🔐 Optional: Add OpenAI API Key

For even better AI explanations:

1. Get free API key: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Open `backend/.env` in a text editor
3. Replace `your_openai_api_key_here` with your actual key
4. Restart backend (Ctrl+C, then `python main.py`)

**Without API key**: Rule-based explanations (still good!)
**With API key**: AI-generated personalized explanations (amazing!)
